Convex-Hull-3D
==============

[Click here to run the project on web] (http://engr.uconn.edu/~abm12008/convexhull/)

The project accepts list of points in three dimensional space. The points have (x, y, z) coordinates, which specify a specific position for that point in that 3d space. Users can generate desired number of points randomly. Another option is to provide a .csv or .txt formatted file containing coordinates of points.

The application is interactive. Users can move through different phases of the construction of the convex hull. Vertices are of different colors to differentiate among on hull, inside hull, exploring and unexplored vertices. When a new vertex is being explored, some faces may be removed, and some may be added. Therefore faces are also be of multiple colors. Users observe the construction of the hull from different positions of the space by moving camera. Lighting will also be used to realize the color effect of faces.
